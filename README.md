I want to build a logic analyzer from the following parts:
Ardunio mega ADK
Arduino mega shield
Flashy capture card (knjn.com)
Android phone for display

But the mega shield isn't very good for anything because it is just a bunch of holes...
In order to use it for anything you have to soldier blob everywhere, which I don't like.
So I intend to fix it.

To see the shield check out this image:
